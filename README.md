# MUD WebClient

A very simple webclient for connecting to MUD/MUX/MUSH (or other telnet applications, really) via websocket.

A separate service (such as [midgaard_websocket](https://github.com/HappyTetrahedron/midgaard_websocket)) is needed that bridges between websocket and telnet - this repository contains the client website only.

## Configuration

Some basic configuration can be done in `configuration.js`, check there for options.
